help other members of the club. We are looking for experts in the following areas:

- iOS Frontend
- Android Frontend
- App Backend (which includes designing and implementing RESTful APIs)
- UI/UX
- Databases
- Third Party Services (on how to use different APIs which are considered third party)
- Marketting

There is no special process to become a mentor! Any member who walks around during the meetings and helps other
members rather than doing his/her own project is considered a mentor.

##Impeachment/Disciplinary Process
A movement to impeach an executive officer may be made by any executive officer or by 
petition of at least five voting members. 
When the motion is made the Clubs Director will be informed. A general meeting will be 
called as soon as is reasonably possible. No club funds will be spent until the issue is 
resolved. 

At the impeachment meeting, the person or persons that initiated the process will state 
their case. Afterwards, the officer under impeachment will have an opportunity to reply. 
There will be a question period after which a vote will be taken by a CRO designated by 
an executive member who is neither initiator nor subject of the impeachment. If there is no such officer, any club member may volunteer. 
The vote will be by yes/no secret ballot. If at least two thirds of the votes are for 
impeachment, the officer will immediately be stripped of his or her position. The 
remaining executive may choose to call an immediate by-election to replace that officer. 

##Meetings 
We will hold weekly general meetings and monthly executive meetings. The first 
meeting of the following term will be set up by the outgoing executive. At that meeting 
subsequent meeting times and locations will be set. Meeting times and dates will be 
forwarded to members via Facebook. Quorum will be 7 peoplefor general meetings and 2 for executive 
meetings. An emergency meeting can be called by any executive via Facebook and must sent 
at least 48 hours prior to the meeting time. 

##Amendments 
Constitutional amendments may be proposed by any officer. The amendment will then 
be voted on by referendum. The voting procedure will be the same as for the 
impeachment process. 
If the vote passes, the amendment and the vote count will be passed to the Clubs Director 
for final approval from the Internal Administration Committee. If it is approved the 
constitution will be amended and a note describing the amendment and the date it was 
made will inserted in section 1 of the constitution. 

##Affiliations 
We are not currently affiliated with any organizations. Any additional affiliations must be 
added by following the amendment process and amending this constitution to reflect any 
changes in the affiliation section and is at the discretion of the Internal Administration 
Committee.
